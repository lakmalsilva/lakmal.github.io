          <em>Background:</em>
          Requirements engineering and verification (REV) processes play essential roles in software product development. There are physical and non-physical distances between entities (actors, artifacts, and activities) in these processes. Current practices that reduce the distances, such as automated testing and alignment of document structure and tracing only partially close the above mentioned gap.  

          <em>Objective:</em>
          The aim of this thesis is to investigate solutions w.r.t their ability to reduce the distances between requirements engineering and verification. Two techniques that are explored in this thesis are automated testing (model-based testing, MBT) and alignment of document structure and tracing (traceability).

          <em>Method:</em>
          The research methods used in this thesis are systematic mapping, software requirements mining, case study, literature survey, validation study, and design science.


          <em>Results:</em>
          MBT and traceability are effective in reducing the distance between requirements and verification. However, both activities have some shortcoming that needs to be addressed when used for that purpose. Current MBT techniques in the context of software performance do not attain all the goals of MBT: 1) requirements validation, 2) checking the testability of requirements, and 3) the generation of an efficient test suite. These goals are essential to reduce the distance. We developed and assessed performance requirements verification and test environment generation approach to tackle these shortcomings. Also, traceability between requirements and verification suffers from the low granularity of trace links and does not support the verification of all requirements.  We propose the use of taxonomic trace links to trace and align the structure of requirements specifications and verification artifacts. The results from the validation study show that the solution is feasible in practice. However, this comes with challenges that need to be addressed.

          <em>Conclusion:</em>
          MBT and improved traceability reduce multiple distances between actors, artifacts, and activities in the requirements engineering and verification process. MBT is most effective in reducing the distances when the model used is built from the requirements. Traceability is essential in easing access to relevant information when needed and should not be seen as an overhead. When creating trace links, we need to consider the difference in the abstraction, structure, and time between the linked artifacts

        <em>Background:</em>
        Model-Based Testing (MBT) is a method that supports the design and execution of test cases by models that specify the intended behaviors of a system under test.
        
        <em>Motivation:</em>
        While systematic literature reviews on MBT in general exist, the state-of-the-art on modeling and testing performance requirements has seen much less attention. 
        
        <em>Method:</em>        
        Therefore, we conducted a systematic mapping study on model-based performance testing. Then, we studied natural language software requirements specifications in order to understand which and how performance requirements are typically specified. Since none of the identified MBT techniques supported a major benefit of modeling, namely identifying faults in requirements specifications, we developed the Performance Requirements verificatiOn and Test EnvironmentS generaTion approach (PRO-TEST). Finally, we evaluated PRO-TEST on 149 requirements specifications. 
        
        <em>Results:</em>
        We found and analyzed 57 primary studies from the systematic mapping study, and extracted 50 performance requirements models. However, those models don't achieve the goals of MBT, which are validating requirements, ensuring their testability, and generating the minimum required test cases. We analyzed 77 Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents, extracted 149 performance requirements from those SRS, and illustrate that with PRO-TEST we can model performance requirements, find issues in those requirements and detect missing ones. We detected three not-quantifiable requirements, 43 not-quantified requirements, and 180 underspecified parameters in the 149 modeled performance requirements. Furthermore, we generated 96 test environments from those models. 
        
        <em>Conclusion:</em>
        By modeling performance requirements with PRO-TEST, we can identify issues in the requirements related to their ambiguity, measurability, and completeness. Additionally, it allows to generate parameters for test environments.
